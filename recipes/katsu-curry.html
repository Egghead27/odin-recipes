        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Cut the onion into half moons. Put some frying oil and a little bit of water into the pot and caramelize the onion in the pot for about 15-20 minutes. Season with salt.</li>
                <li>Cut the carrots and potatoes into small chunks.</li>
                <li>After the onion has browned and caramelized, put in the carrots and potatoes to fry until glistening and coated with the oil, usually about 10 minutes. </li>
                <li>Put the 4 cups of water in the pot and leave it all to simmer aggressively for 30 minutes. Season with salt and white pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>After all the vegetable has soften, put in the two curry blocks and leaving it to simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. And the curry is done.</li>
                <li>Onto the katsu, beat the chicken breast with a meat mallet (or any object with a flat surface) to flatten it, this ensures an even cooking process.</li>
                <li>Lightly season the chicken breast with salt and black pepper.</li>
                <li>Season the flour and bread crumbs with some salt and black pepper</li>
                <li>Coat the chicken with the flour, eggs and then the bread crumbs.</li>
                <li>Fry the chicken at about 180 celcius for 2 minutes on each side until crispy and golden brown. </li>
                <li>Pour the curry beside a bed of rice, slice the katsu and put it on top of the rice and curry. Now you've got a meal that'll bring comfort straight to your stomach.</li>
